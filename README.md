# Morse_Code_Converter
Morse code is a method of communication that is used in conjunction with an electromagnetic telegraph. By harnessing the telegraph's ability to transmit electrical pulses, it revolutionized communication. It allowed messages to be sent across long distances within minutes.

Morse code has an important syntax where there is a spacing of 3 dots between each letter and a spacing of 7 dots between each word. This holds true for this application as well.

The following application displays a chart that shows letter to morse code conversion. Once closed, the user has the choice to convert text to morse code or vice versa. Tkinter is used to create the chart and winsound is used to make the sound made by the morse code.
